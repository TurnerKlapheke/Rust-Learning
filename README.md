# Rust-Learning
Collection of all of the exercises and projects I did to get a very basic handle on programming in rust
I followed along with the advice given by "No Boilerplate" on how to learn rust
Materials included rustup.rs, The rustup book, Rust By Example, the github repository "rustlings", and Brown Universities interactive version of "The Rust Programming Language"
